Our wizards bring strange news. A [b]scroll[/b] has suddenly appeared in the wizard tower. Our wizards have been busy all morning trying to decypher the message, and this is what it reads:

---
[b]Dor Daedeloth[/b]
In a far region of the Underworld, in the land that is called Dor Daedeloth, lies the secret to everlasting power. 
Whoever is lord of the castle, he shall rule the world forever.
---

Our wizards have also found a magical formula on the scroll, it appears it will open a portal when casted.

The wizards await your command in one of the wizard towers.
